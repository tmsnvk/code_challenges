// A Circle and Two Square
// Imagine a circle and two squares: a smaller and a bigger one.
// For the smaller one, the circle is a circumcircle and for the bigger one, an incircle.
// Create a function, that takes an integer (radius of the circle) and returns the difference of the square-areas.

function squareAreasDifference(r) {
	return 2 * Math.pow(r, 2);
}
