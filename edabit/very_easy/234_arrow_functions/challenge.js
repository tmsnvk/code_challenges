// In the Code tab you will find code that is missing a single character in order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as minimalist as possible. Use the tips in the tips section below.

// Write five adder functions:

// add2(x) should return 2 + x.
// add3(x) should return 3 + x.
// add5(x) should return 5 + x.
// add7(x) should return 7 + x.
// add11(x) should return 11 + x.

const add2 = (x) => x + 2;

const add3 = (x) => x + 3;

const add5 = (x) => x + 5;

const add7 = (x) => x + 7;

const add11 = (x) => x + 11;
