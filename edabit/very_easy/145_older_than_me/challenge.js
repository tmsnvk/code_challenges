// Older Than Me
// Create a method in the Person class which returns how another person's age compares. 
// Given the instances p1, p2 and p3, which will be initialised with the attributes name and age, 
// return a sentence in the following format:

// {other person name} is {older than / younger than / the same age as} me.

class Person {
	constructor(name, age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}

	compareAge(other) {
		if (this.age > other.age) {
			return `${other.name} is younger than me.`;
		} else if (this.age < other.age) {
			return `${other.name} is older than me.`;
		} else {
			return `${other.name} is the same age as me.`;
