// Due to a programming concept known as truthiness, certain values can be evaluated to (i.e. take the place of) booleans. For example, 1 (or any number other than 0) is often equivalent to true, and 0 is often equivalent to false.

// Create a function that returns the opposite of the given boolean, as a number.

// Examples
// flipBool(true) ➞ 0

// flipBool(false) ➞ 1

// flipBool(1) ➞ 0

// flipBool(0) ➞ 1

function flipBool(b) {
	return b > 0 || b ? 0 : 1; 
}
