// RegEx: Character Classes IX ‚Å†- \w
// You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. 
// They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.
// Here are a list of the characters classes in JavaScript:

// ., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]

// There is a hidden word in this string:
// const str = "**^&$Regular#$%Expressions$%$$%^**"

// Write the regular expression that reveals the hidden word. You have to remove all of the special characters to reveal the word. 
// Use the character class \w in your expression.

const REGEXP = /\w/g;
